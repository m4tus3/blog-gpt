As the first day of spring arrived, the flowers began to bloom and fill the forest with their sweet fragrance. The animals woke up from their long winter nap and started to explore the forest.

The birds chirped happily as they flew from tree to tree, while the rabbits hopped around in the grass. The bees buzzed around the flowers, collecting nectar to make honey.
